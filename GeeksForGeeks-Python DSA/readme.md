# Points Learnt from Course
- What is Asymptotic Analysis

    1. No dependency on the Machine, programming languages , etc
    2. No need to implement all the ideas/algos, even the pseudo code works
    3. Asymptotic Analysis is about measuring order of growth in terms of input size. 

- What is order of growth
    1. Usefull while doing theoritical analysis of Algorithm
    2. A function f(n) is said to be growing faster than g(n), if one of the condition is true
